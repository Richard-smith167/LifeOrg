<h2>Who we are.</h2>
<p>Life Org was created due to my hectic lifestyle. Being in the navy, going to school, having side jobs, 
    and having hobbies life always got away from me. I needed a way to track all of my events and obligations in one place. 
    When I tried to find it I either had to use multiple applications, or the design of the product made the product almost unusable. 
    So in turn I decided to create my own, and that is how Life Org was born.
